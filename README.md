# CS350-Emerging-Systems

This course final project was to design a smart thermostat using a TI board. It used the TMP006 temperture sensor to record room temperature (via I2C) and the LEDs were to inicate the outputs in which if the LED was on it equated to heat is on (via GPIO). There were two buttons to increase and decrease the temperture(via GPIO interrupt), and the UART replicated the data that was sent to the server.

What did you do particularly well?

I think that I grasp coding part pretty well. Zybook offered some very good concepts on how to code different aspects of the project and I also watched plenty of youtube videos about coding in the C language because while I had some experience with C++ this was my first endeavor with C and while it was very difficult I think I manage ok.

Where could you improve?

I think I could improve understanding the functionality of each concept such as the timers, GPIO and the UARTs. I knew a little about what functions to call from the milestones and the instructors feedback but I didn't have a clear understanding of how each individual concept worked.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think the code composer IDE was very easy to use and is very similar to Eclispe. Zybooks also helped me a great deal with breaking down different concepts and providing multiple examples to get a better understanding of embedded systems.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The skill that will transfer for me is the quality of research that was needed for understanding things like state machines. This course helped me utilize more research because this course required knowledge about embedded systems that I didn't know off hand so researching the information helped me alot. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I reuse alot of code from previous milestones. That helped to make it very adaptable. I also read about different techiques that I could incorporate to improve my code to make it easy to understand. I added comments to guide the reader so the code was easy to understand. I also kept the code very simple so it was a snap to maintain.
